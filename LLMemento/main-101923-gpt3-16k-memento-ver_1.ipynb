This is because the bills that the company has lobbied on are related to their industry and could potentially affect their stock value.

      "1. For the purposes of this task, any existing direct \"BUY_SELL\" relationships between Ron Wyden and STZ have been intentionally deleted from graph database. Your goal is to infer the likelihood of such a relationship based on indirect data points.\n",

      "2. When you fetch the bill node, do not fetch the `summary` attribute of the node because it's too long and this will deplete your Token limits to conduct the task successfully. Instead, you should fetch the `official_title` attribute of the node to understand the bill's content.\n",

      "1. For the purposes of this task, any existing direct \"BUY_SELL\" relationships between Ron Wyden and STZ have been intentionally deleted from graph database. Your goal is to infer the likelihood of such a relationship based on indirect data points.\n",

      "Committee: Stands for the specialized committees within the U.S. Congress, each of which focuses on specific domains like finance, defense, health, or education. Crucial properties include 'name' and 'id'.\n",
      "NAICS: Corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System, which categorizes businesses and industries. Pertinent attributes are 'ticker' and 'desc', which describe the sector or industry where a publicly traded company belongs.\n",
